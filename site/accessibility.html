        <h2>Commitment to Inclusive Access</h2>
        <p>We design every page so people with disabilities can easily perceive, understand, and interact with our content. This resource collects tips to make your own vocational rehabilitation tools accessible.</p>
        <h2>WCAG Compliance</h2>
        <p>All resources should meet at least WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Provide semantic headings, keyboard-friendly navigation, and sufficient color contrast.</p>
        <h2>Document &amp; Media Accessibility</h2>
        <p>Images require descriptive alt text. Videos should include captions and audio descriptions. PDFs must be tagged for screen reader compatibility and text transcripts should be supplied for audio-only files.</p>
        <h2>Keyboard Navigation &amp; Focus Management</h2>
        <p>Ensure every interactive control can be reached using the keyboard alone. Maintain a logical focus order and provide clear focus styles so users always know where they are on the page.</p>
        <h2>Assistive Technology Support</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Use semantic HTML elements so screen readers can announce content correctly.</li>
            <li>Provide ARIA labels for custom widgets and buttons.</li>
            <li>Ensure forms and navigation work with voice control and switch devices.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For complex data visualizations, provide text summaries or table alternatives so screen-reader users can access key insights. Consider sonification as a supplementary technique.</p>
        <h2>Color Contrast &amp; Visual Design</h2>
        <p>Our dark theme uses a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text. Test color combinations with automated tools and avoid conveying meaning with color alone.</p>
        <h2>Accessible Forms</h2>
        <p>Associate each input field with a <code>label</code> element. Describe errors using <code>aria-describedby</code> and provide plainâ€‘language instructions for completing forms.</p>
        <h2>Responsive Layouts</h2>
        <p>Layouts reflow for small screens without horizontal scrolling. Use relative units and test zoomed text up to 200% to confirm readability.</p>
        <h2>Testing Resources</h2>
        <p>Automated tools like axe-core, pa11y, and browser accessibility checkers help locate issues early. Manual testing with screen readers and keyboard only is essential. See our <a href="../ACCESSIBILITY_REQUIREMENTS.md">Accessibility Requirements</a> for full guidelines.</p>
        <h2>Continuous Improvement</h2>
        <p>Accessibility is an ongoing effort. We welcome bug reports or suggestions on our GitHub repository so we can keep refining these resources.</p>
        <p>Incorporating feedback from people with a wide range of disabilities is essential. Conduct usability testing with screen readers, magnifiers, and alternative input devices to uncover real-world barriers.</p>
